# Benchmark Visualizer

Simple crudely written visualizer for the google benchmark results for [Paradigm Engine](https://github.com/JessyDL/paradigm). Whenever successful builds with benchmarks are completed it announces the results here and then the script here will turn it into a static html page where the data can be seen in graphs with their evolution over the past few builds.

This project isn't really properly written, so it makes little sense to fork or use it anywhere else. It's more of a vehicle for the benchmarks but if you're willing to use it, feel free to. It's MIT licensed, and no accreditation is needed.
